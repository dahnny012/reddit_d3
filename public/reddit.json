This is something that has been obvious for a while now; you can look at the flat armor pen build ADCs from last season, Luc Jhin MF. Those adcs were able to bypass the ridiculous scaling time that traditional builds take and be more relevant earlier in the game because, well, games just don't last that long.

(As a side note I hated the armor pen builds and I actually am a little glad that they were removed. What I'm *not* glad about is the failure to address the issue of why they were popular in the first place and how things have pretty much just gone downhill from there for ADC).\n\nWhile you're waiting for your three items, the tanks, mages, &amp; bruisers (basically anything that's not ADC or supp) are spiking at 1 or 2 items. You are either going to tickle with them with your autos, get crushed by them, or both. A lead in any of the non-bot roles translates so much more easily into a win than a lead in bot. At this point, if you're playing ADC you're kind of just crossing your fingers and hoping that your team doesn't fuck up and let the other lanes get out of control before you're even at your IE and zeal item. You have such little influence as ADC early on in the game compared to the other roles. Better hope that your jungle knows how to play jungle too, because he's the one with the most influence right now.\n\nNot only does it take forever for you to get to your necessary items, the build path is kind of shit too. BF into zeal item means you're getting parts and pieces of stats. Your stats are all multiplicative, so you need ALL of them to start doing damage. BF into zeal item just fucking sucks. And your damage is pathetic against the tank who got to build just one armor item and still wreck you. Because unlike you, they get to build a ton of flat stats first!\n\nPeople may say that you need to position better. But the enemy team is either going to try to pop you first thing in the fight or zone you off. You rely so heavily on your team to play the fight out right. I'm not saying that ADC should be able to 1v1 everyone, but right now you have so few options to help yourself. You literally cannot do anything alone. Sure some people say that that's the whole point--as a role that builds straight damage and will output a ton of damage, you should be team reliant to survive. Well, the problem with that is that your \"straight damage\" build is multiplicative and totally worthless until you have 3+ items. That, coupled with the fact that the tank or bruiser or mage with his 1 item power spike is going to destroy you, makes it very very frustrating to play ADC.\n\nAnd then we got Courage of the Colossus! Lovely. Give the tanks more HP-scaling shields on top of the ones they already have in their kit... or maybe let the bruisers have their own easy to proc shields... That can't possibly go wrong, can it? Right now shields are absolutely busted. They just straight up need to be nerfed. There are way too many that are way too powerful, either in terms of stats, CDs, or both. It's like Riot ran out of ideas and was just like \"Oh well, better add some more shields!\"\n\nIf you have a tank with his own HP-scaling shield, colossus, and locket... it's ridiculous. It takes you so long to cut through that. It lets a tank throw himself into a fight and stay alive for about... well, forever, esp since you get rewarded for being closer to multiple enemy champions with CoC.\n\nThe way ADCs scale with their items right now is total crap. It's just straight up bad. The game is even more snowbally now too with the first tower gold.
